# HealthWatch
An android application that interfaces with a QN9020DK microcontroller to take blood pressure readings via a Honeywell Pressure Sensor. The application has the following sections.

Measure: In this section, the patient the blood pressure measurement by clicking a button. The application then checks if the Bluetooth is on, or prompts the user to turn it on if it is off. Next, it instructs the device to start measurement, while a waiting screen is loaded. On the waiting screen, the pressure applied by the constricting device will be displayed. The application will load the final screen once the diastolic and systolic pressures have been sent to the device. The patient will also have a textbox on the final screen to make a note, as well as two buttons to either save the pressure values or repeat the measurement. The saved data includes the diastolic and systolic pressures, time of measurement, comment, and GPS location.

History: In this section, the patient will consult previously saved blood pressure measurements presented in a graph. There will be an option to view the daily, monthly and yearly progress of blood pressure and an option to do so with a variety of graphs. Visuals will be color-coded based on the blood pressure measurement. If the reading is within a healthy range, data will appear green. If moderately unhealthy, the data will appear yellow, and if dangerous, the reading will appear red. 

Help: In this section, the patient will consult a demo video on how to place the constricting mechanism accurately, learn about what the measured data indicates, and learn how to calibrate the constricting mechanism, if necessary.

Health: In this section, the user will find relevant information about maintaining a healthy lifestyle. This will include tips, articles, and expert advice. Mores specifically, the health section will consist of a dynamic Application Program Interface (API) that will update with new health information as it becomes available.

Settings: In this section, the patient will choose between manual or automatic measurement. In an automatic measurement, the patient will be required to enter a time frame and the frequency of the desired measurements. The application will notify the patient when the next blood pressure reading is near. In a manual measurement, the patient is allowed to record their blood pressure at any time.
